They say that necessity is the mother of all inventions. Although I'm not sure about the accuracy of such quote, I learned from my mentors to always attribute each and every achievement to the God of the Bible.

# 1. Background

Just last week, @krevasilis sent a message in discord asking if there was site similar to [steemnow](https://www.steemnow.com/) or [hive-now](https://hive-now.com/) for blurt. I waited for some time to see if anyone would chime in and build it, but didn't see any.

When starting or doing any project as a community developer, I believe that the most challenging part is finding the time to start and finish one. It's easy to start any project, but what's more challenging is maintaining it.

With God's help, I was able to somehow reach a milestone for this project - https://blurt-now.com/.

# 2. Features

Although I believe the site's UI is intuitive, this is just a quick walk-through of the site's features.

## 2.1. User Settings

<div class="pull-left">

</div>

Located at the top-most right of the page, it lets you input your blurt account, select a node, and select a theme.

***

### 2.1.1. What's a Node?

For those not familiar, a node is basically a service one uses to retrieve data from the blockchain. A list of publicly available seed nodes is available in one of the [project's markdown files](https://gitlab.com/blurt/blurt/-/blob/dev/doc/devs/networknodes.md).

When using the site and you encounter an issue of not being able to retrieve any data for an account, consider switching the node and click **Save**. (This will save your chosen node in your [browser's local storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage)).

### 2.1.2. Theme

</div>

Ever get bored of seeing the site? Try changing the site's theme and look at it on a different light. :)

Here, you can select the theme you want to see the site in. One of my favorites is sketchy. 

## 2.2. Daily Rewards

You can always look at [your wallet](https://blurtwallet.com) and look into curation and author rewards, or you can visit this site and see it in one place.

## 2.3 Account Info

Here, you can see how much your full vote is, your liquid BLURT, and total VESTS (BLURT POWER).

*(Caveat: upvote value calculator is still a work in progress, but the value shown is a rough estimate)*

## 2.4. Voting Power Bar

# 3. Difference with steemnow and hive-now

I'm not sure if the repository for these websites are available, but as an open-source benefactor and lead curator of #blurtopian, I opted to make the repository open.

The project's source codes are available in github and is served using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

https://github.com/blurtnow/blurtnow.github.io

I plan to push the repository to [openblurt](https://gitlab.com/blurt/openblurt) as well when an appropriate master branch becomes available.

# 4. Feedback and Comments

Please feel free to create a ticket in the project's repository or leave a comment in this post.

# 5. Credits

Thanks to @megadrive and @ilnegro for the feedback.
